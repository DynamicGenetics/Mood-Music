## Latest Updates
**April 2021**  
Our first main software output is now available on GitHub. You can use the [Spotify Rehydrator](https://github.com/DynamicGenetics/Spotify-Rehydrator) to get a full dataset of music features from participant data.  
We've made this to help other people who might want to run similar studies, as well as to help people re-use the datasets we are collecting once they are shared.
To say thanks to our participants we also sent them a personalised dashboard about their music data, and [the code for this is also available for re-use](https://github.com/ninadicara/spotify-dashboard). 

**Jan 2021**  
Our pilot study has launched! We'll be recruiting University of Bristol students to take part. 

**Dec 2020**  
We've completed our series of participant advisory groups and are ready to get started with a pilot study.

**Aug 2021**
